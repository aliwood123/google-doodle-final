# Glass Blowing Google Doodle

Glass blowing is dynamic. It  not only creates stunning visual art, but the technique itself is performative art. With skill, precision, and utmost focus, the artist literally breathes life into their creations and  must engage in a precisely choreographed routine to transition this volatile medium from solid to liquid and back again. 

While this would be impressive in its own right, consider the physical demands of the hot shop. The furnace containing the molten glass must keep a constant temperature of 2150 degrees Fahrenheit. Once the initial gather has taken place, the glass must be cooled and heated multiple times throughout the process to achieve the desired outcome. The larger the artwork, the heavier the blow pipe becomes. 

I am in awe of these artists, who create such masterful works of art, using tools such as breath, gravity, and heat.
